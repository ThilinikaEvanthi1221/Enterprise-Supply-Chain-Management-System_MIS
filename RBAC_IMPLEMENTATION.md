2. **Role-Based Dashboards:** Each role gets contextually relevant information
3. **Sidebar Filtering:** Clean UX - users don't see what they can't access
4. **Access Denied Page:** Clear messaging when attempting restricted access
5. **Sri Lankan Localization:** All users, locations, and currency localized
